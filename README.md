# Lightning Payments Draft

This (very draft!) proposal builds on
[bech32 encoding](https://github.com/sipa/bech32/blob/master/bip-witaddr.mediawiki),
while providing a minimal QR-code-ready format for requesting
lightning payments.

Human readable part:
1. Prefix: "ln" + BIP-bech32 currency prefix (eg. lnbc, lntb)
1. Amount in milli(satoshi) (k/m/g accepted here)

And data part:
1. Version: 0 (5 bits)
1. Payment hash (256 bits)
1. Dest channel id (high bit == which end) (64 bits)
1. Zero or more tagged parts.
1. Signature (bitcoin-style, of SHA256(SHA256()) of above. (256 bits)

Tagged parts are of format:
1. type (5 bits)
1. length (10 bits)
1. data (length x 5 bits)

Currently defined tagged parts are:
1. d: short description of purpose of payment (ASCII).  eg. '1 cup of coffee'
1. h: description of purpose of payment (SHA256).  This is used to commit
   to an associated description which is too long to fit, such as may
   be contained in a web page.
1. f: fallback onchain-address.  20 bytes == p2pkh.  21 bytes == p2wpkh.
1. r: extra routing information.  This should be appended to the route
      to allow routing to non-public nodes; there may be more
	  than one of these.
   1. pubkey (264 bits)
   1. channel id (64 bits)
   1. fee (32 bits)
   1. ctlv (32 bits)

## TODO

1. Implement signatures and checking in the demo code (currently it's 64 zeroes)

1. Don't just encode address string for fallback, but pull it apart,
   check it, and include the RIPEMD160.

## Examples (from [examples.sh](examples.sh)):

You can find a [python implementation](lightning-address.py) in this
repository, which produces these.  You can feed them back into
`lightning-address.py decode` too:
